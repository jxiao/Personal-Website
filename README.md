# Personal Website (jeffreyxiao.com)

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/e17a0241-daeb-473d-9a3b-53f8d61623ca/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/determined-joliot-93d656/deploys)

Revamping my personal site once again, this time using the Hugo framework. All code here is written while learning the Hugo framework, so feedback on things to improve/features are welcome!

Theme: inspired from https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng/

## Design
- https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng
- https://davi.sh/
- https://github.com/davish/davi.sh
- https://pawa.lt/

## Features
### Navbar
- [x] Top left -> working directory of page
### Home Page
- [x] Name and profile picture
- [x] Quick buttons to external/profile sites (eg. GitHub, LinkedIn, Mail, Resume)
- [ ] Brief blurb
### About Page
- [ ] Brief description of me, projects worked on
### Bucket List Page
- [ ] Checkboxed list with things I want to do
    - Two sections (things done and things to do, possibly in progress)
    - Things done suffixed with date
    - Individual items can be prefixed with number indicating number item when added to list (eg. 17 / Building a PC)
    - Multiple views (by date, by progress, by item number)
- View can either be a table (https://davi.sh/til/) or sections with headers
### Blog Page
- Similar to https://pawa.lt/posts/
- [ ] Simple page, short preview of each entry
    - Hopefully, this pushes me to blog/write more
