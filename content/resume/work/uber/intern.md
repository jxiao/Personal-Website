Member of [Uber's Marketplace Matching Inference](https://www.uber.com/us/en/marketplace/matching/) team. Designed, developed, and documented an internal tool to query live algorithm settings for more accurate matching simulations. Later, built a full-stack application to bulk create switchback simulations for improved A/B testing and reduced outages.
